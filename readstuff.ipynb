      "this film was just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyone's really suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert redford's is an amazing actor and now the same being director norman's father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boy's that played the part's of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don't you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with us all\n",

      "french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene maléfique preceded the revival just slightly but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made maléfique was obviously shot on a low budget but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic the central character is a man named carrère sent to prison for fraud he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane lassalle body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy after a short while in the cell together they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal after translating part of it they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls br br black magic is a very interesting topic and i'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it it's fair to say that maléfique makes the best of it's assets as despite it's restraints the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell it's very easy to get behind them it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner and this helps to ensure that maléfique actually does manage to be quite frightening the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying overall maléfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade highly recommended viewing\n",

      "in this swimming pool this pond there are water lilies and there are frogs frogs sit on water lilies the frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship marie pauline acquart is a water lily a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on floraine adele haenel a frog the captain of her team floraine's teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer's mindset of conformity and discipline but floraine has a secret the bombshell has a bombshell which naissance des pieuvres reveals to the audience visually before she confides in marie br br floraine has never gone as they say all the way with a boy br br at a party we see a double image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make up in a bathroom mirror lolita is a fata morgana marie gets to know floraine's double while her imitation breaks the water lily's heart while the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance's sake she gets chummy with the water lily when no one's looking in the film's most startling scene the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation floraine wants boys to like her but she doesn't like boys seemingly but it's more important to the frog that she's popular when the water lily finally kisses the frog the frog remains a frog the frog can't transform into a water lily or a princess because the water lily lost the frog's respect after their lips unlock floraine tells marie see it's easy which is the frog's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite of passage without any strings attached floraine's beauty is a burden she carries the weight of meeting boy's expectations florence uses marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet br br the other water lily the other frog marie's best friend anne louise blachere and floraine's frustrated boy toy francois warren jacobs just like any water lily and frog have a parasitic relationship too while floraine uses marie for love francois uses anne for sex but that's life that's the treachery of growing up in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself at a mcdonalds the water lily chastises the other water lily after bathing extensively in the frog's afterglow physical beauty is a currency marie gets to call the shots because anne although far from being ugly is overweight and has an unflattering hairdo anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation the magnifying glass from her happy meal incidentally comments on marie's flat chest but the tadpole marie thinks she's better than anne better than a water lily points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat br br teenaged girls can be brutal to each other br br later in the final shot naissance des pieuvres suggests that marie has a double too and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near future if it not already has teenaged girls can be brutal to each other in a way that no boy could match\n",
